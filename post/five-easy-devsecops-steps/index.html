It is not the shiny new thing it used to be anymore.\nWe need something new.\nMaybe something security related, security is always an important aspect of creating software.

Whichever order we put them in, now that the letters ‘sec’ are part of our abbreviation, we can finally make our software and processes secure. All of those critical security fixes that were denied because security was not in the name can finally be merged! Because you know, if it is not explicitly mentioned, you should not think about it or do it.\nSpeaking of explicitly mentioning things, having our software be reliable is probably also important.

Do we really have to mention explicitly that something is part of our way of working to do it, and do it well?\nSo how can you get started with doing DevOps securely? Here’s five easy steps to get you started.\n  Use a secret manager like Azure Keyvault with managed identity in your application to store any secrets, certificates and keys in a central place and access them securely. This way, even if your machine is compromised, the chance of your secrets leaking is reduced.\n  Use a secret scanning tool like Github’s built in secret scanning, or git-secrets to prevent any secrets from being committed to your main branch. Automate this, so preferably use it in your pipelines\n  Scan your external dependencies (eg packages) for security issues and outdated versions and keep them up to date with tools like SonarCloud\n  Scan your own compiled binaries/artifacts for potential vulerabilities . For instance using Nexus Scan\n  Use Privileged Identity Management to manage access to production infrastructure and data. Nobody has access by default, but can easily gain access without too much slowdown, and it leaves an audit trail for whoever touched production.\n  ",

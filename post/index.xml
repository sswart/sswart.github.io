      <description>dotnet MAUI public key pinning When it comes to client-side security, mobile apps can be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, the software is on a user-controlled device, so security is out of your hands. On the other hand, that device will probably connect to any old public wifi that it can get its hands on. Man-in-the-middle attacks are a definite risk.
Luckily, we can improve protection against these by using certificate pinning, or public key pinning.</description>

      <description>The DevOps movement has claimed it&amp;rsquo;s rightful place in our hearts. If it hasn&amp;rsquo;t, go read up on it. Working in a proper DevOps environment is amazing, and I cannot recommend enough for any organization to try it.
But, let&amp;rsquo;s be real. DevOps has been around for a while. It is not the shiny new thing it used to be anymore.
We need something new.
Maybe something security related, security is always an important aspect of creating software.</description>
